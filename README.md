How I did my project?

I started to read a lot about what was happening in Latin America, and that’s how I heard about the crisis in Costa Rica. I continued reading about it because I was very interested in knowing what was happening. 

What data and tools I used?

I used data from different sources: U.S Costums and Border Protection, U.S Department of Homeland Security, the Pew Research Center. Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. 

I used Cartodb to do the map, although I am trying to build another one using mapbox – a tool that Jue suggested me to use, but that requires some knowledge on coding -- and I also used infogr.am to build the chart. 

I had difficulties trying to embed the chart in html. Something was “wrong” with the coding and so I had to figure out another way to show the chart. I decided to embedded as an image and added a link to the website, without loosing the interactivity of the chart.
